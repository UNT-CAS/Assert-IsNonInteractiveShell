.SYNOPSIS
Returns boolean determining if prompt was run noninteractive.
.DESCRIPTION
First, we check `[Environment]::UserInteractive` to determine if we're if the shell if running 
interactively. An example of not running interactively would be if the shell is running as a service.

If we are running interactively, we check the Command Line Arguments to see if the `-NonInteractive` 
switch was used; or an abbreviation of the switch.
